# CS3337FinalProject

This code repository contains the collaborative final project for the course CS 3337-01 Software Design, Fall 2022. 

This project uses the Django framework to design and build a book evaluation system. Users are able to post a book, view all books, search for a book, rate a book, comment on a book, and add a book to their "favorites" list.  The base of the project (postbook, displaybook, book_detail, mybooks) was done with the instructor's (Dr. Jiang Guo) guidance through the first eleven weeks of the semester (August 22, 2022 - November 09, 2022). The rest of the functionality (searchbook, book_detail_rate, add_comment, add_favorite, aboutus) and formatting (with CSS + bootstrap) was implemented in the following two weeks, independently (November 14, 2022 - November 25, 2022).
